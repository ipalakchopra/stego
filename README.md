Introduction
•	Image Steganography is the process of concealing data within an image file. 
•	The image chosen for this purpose, in our project, is referred to as the base image, the image being hidden is known as the code image, and the image obtained after steganography is referred to as the encoded image.
•	It provides security through obscurity, combining steganography and cryptography is the most effective way to hide a message from adversaries while still protecting it if it is discovered.

Problem Statement
•	We aim to create a software based on image-based steganography system to hide an image inside another image for safe transmission of the same.
•	This will be done using a custom algorithm, using concepts like bit-plane slicing, LSB, and sorting.
•	The result will be an executable software that takes input a base and code image, and gives result, encoded image.
•	We will also be able to obtain the code image from an encoded image.
